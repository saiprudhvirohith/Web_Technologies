In fact, she is the most precious gift of God for anyone. A child can see the world only because of her. She is a friend, parent, guide, and teacher to her child. She takes care of the entire family and turns a house into a beautiful home. She brings up her children with the utmost care, compassion and love. She illuminates our homes with her presence and smile. The word Mother itself brings emotions to us and every child is very emotionally attached to their mothers. The safest a child can feel is in the warmth of his/her mother’s lap.</b></p></div>

They are the person who will always have your back no matter what. They will always make you feel at ease and will always make sure to also irritate you to the fullest. I have an elder sister who is nearly nine years older than me. She has always been there for me. She makes my day happier and more enjoyable. We even go shopping together and go out to the movies. I love spending time with her. She is one of the most precious gifts I have had in my life.</b></p></div>
